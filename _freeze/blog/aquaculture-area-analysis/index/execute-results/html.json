Marine aquaculture, especially offshore marine aquaculture (Froehlich et al 2017), poses a promising future for a more sustainable method of obtaining enough animal protein to meet global demand for animal protein (Gentry et al 2017). First, it is vital to identify what areas to target for the development of marine aquaculture, but this will likely be species-specific, as different species' physiologies will determine what areas in the ocean are suitable for them. Here, I will focus on determining the suitable area for different species based on their **depth tolerance** and **temperature tolerance**.\n\nHere, I will demonstrate the utility of the generalized function in R to visualize the areas that are suitable for Red Urchin. Sea urchin aquaculture would be widely applicable for society, as sea urchins are not only harvested for their uni and roe for consumption, but they also contain molecules of pharmaceutical importance for ocular disease investigation, and for biologically active food development (Rubilar & Cardozo 2021).\n\n# Data description\n\nI am using **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)** and **Bathymetry** data from the ocean off the West Coast of the USA to calculate the suitable habitat in each of the exclusive economic zones in the area for different marine species of aquaculture interest. The **SST** data was generated from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly, version 3.1, for the years 2008-2012, and each year is a separate raster, so I averaged the SST for each point across the four years and converted to Celsius. The **Bathymetry** data was obtained using General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), for the area west of the USA. In order to determine habitat suitability for certain organisms of aquaculture importance, I used **SeaLifeBase** to gather the minimum and maximum temperature and depth the species can survive at, which are input into analysis. Then, I use the **exclusive economic zone** data, obtained through Marineregions.org, to calculate the suitable area for the species in each of the zones in order to compare across zones.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Plan\n\nThe goal of this work is to create a workflow that can be generalized to any marine species in this geographic areas (in the exclusive economic zones off the West coast of the USA). Thus, I will first walk through the building of the workflow (Part A) for one organism type, oysters. Then in Part B, I will incorporate all of the aspects of the analysis into one function that can work for any species.\n\nIn Part A, I will (1) import and clean the data for downstream analysis, (2) Determine and map the suitable locations based on SST and depth for a a species, (3) calculate the suitable area per exclusive economic zone, and (4) build a map of the habitable area per eez.\n\nIn Part B, I will take the workflow from part A and turn it into a single function, that can take in temperature and depth tolerance data for any species, and output a map with the habitable area per exclusive economic zone in this geographic region.\n\n## Part A\n\n### A.1: Import & clean data\n\nHere, I read in the data, calculate the average sea surface temperature (and convert to Celsius), ensure the bathymetry raster matches the coordinate reference system, extent, and resolution of the SST, and ensure the exclusive economic zone data matches the crs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse) # data wrangling\nlibrary(janitor) # data wrangling\nlibrary(sf) # for spatial data\nlibrary(tmap) # for pretty maps\nlibrary(here) # file pathing\nlibrary(viridisLite) # colors\nlibrary(patchwork) # combine plots\nlibrary(stars) # rasters\nlibrary(terra) # rasters\n\n#..................Sea Surface Temp (SST) Data...................\n# read in each raster, one per year\nsst_2008 <- rast(here::here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2008.tif\")) \nsst_2009 <- rast(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2009.tif\"))\nsst_2010 <- rast(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2010.tif\"))\nsst_2011 <- rast(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2011.tif\"))\nsst_2012 <- rast(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2012.tif\"))\n\n# combine SST rasters into a raster stack\nsst <- c(sst_2008, \n         sst_2009, \n         sst_2010, \n         sst_2011, \n         sst_2012)\n\n#assign names to each raster layer\nnames(sst) <- c(\"2008\", \n         \"2009\",\n         \"2010\",\n         \"2011\",\n         \"2012\")\n\n# local algebra to find the mean sst for each spot\nsst_mean <- mean(sst, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# global algebra to subtract 273.15 to convert from from Kelvin to Celsius\nsst_c <- sst_mean - 273.15\n\n#........................Bathymetry Data.........................\n# read in bathymetry raster\nbath <- rast(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"depth.tif\"))\n\n# SAME CRS: data check: ensure same crs and reporject if it is not\nif(crs(bath) == crs(sst_c)) {\n # print(\"coordinate reference systems match\") # uncomment this for messages to print\n} else{\n  bath <- project(bath, sst_c) \n}\n\n# SAME EXTENT: crop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster\n# crop bathymetry raster to extent of sst_c\nbath_crop <- crop(bath, sst_c)\n\n# SAME RESOLUTION: resample to ensure the resolutions match\n# using the nearest neighbor approach\n# done in discussion section 4\nbath_final <- resample(bath_crop, y = sst_c, \n                          method = \"near\") # for nearest neighbor\n\n#...............Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) Data...............\neez <- st_read(here(\"blog\", \"aquaculture-area-analysis\", \"data\", \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"), \n               quiet = TRUE) # no message output\n\n# crs match\nif(crs(eez) == crs(sst_c)) {\n # print(\"coordinate reference systems match\") # uncomment this for messages to print\n} else{\n  eez <- st_transform(eez, crs = st_crs(sst_c))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n### A.2: Suitable locations for oysters\n\nNow I will find suitable locations for marine aquaculture in terms of both SST and depth. Here, I will use oysters as an example organism, and they can only exist between 11-30 degrees C and -70 through 0 meters below sea level.\n\nI will build matrices for temperature `sst_matrix`, and the depth `bath_matrix`, which include all values from -Infinity to +Infinity, specifying if they are habitable for the species with a 1 or uninhabitable with a 0. Next, I will reclassify the original rasters with whether each area is suitable using its matrix.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# SST first!\n# lets build a matrix\nsst_matrix <- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0, # from -inf temp to 11, too cold, make a 0\n                        11, 30, 1, # good zone! make it 1\n                        30, Inf, 0), # from 30 to inf is too hot, make it a 0\n                        ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# use reclassification matrix to reclassify temperature raster to suitable areas according to temp\nsst_rcl <- classify(sst_c, rcl = sst_matrix)\n\n# Now Depth!\n# lets build a matrix\nbath_matrix <- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, 0, # from -inf to -70 too deep, make a 0\n                        -70, 0, 1, # good zone! make it 1\n                        0, Inf, 0), # 0 to infinity too high\n                        ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# use reclassification matrix to reclassify bathymetry raster to suitable areas according to depth\nbath_rcl <- classify(bath_final, rcl = bath_matrix)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe SST and depth rasters now identify the suitability of locations as 0 or 1. To find locations that have both suitable temperature and depth, I can use a map algebra trick and mulitply the rasters together. This works because anything multiplied by 0 equals 0 and anything multiplied by 1 equals itself. Thus, any areas that are uninhabitable due to temperature or depth or both will be 0, and only areas where both are habitable (multiplying 1\\*1) will end up as 1, also known as habitable area.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# determine the suitable cells using the reclassified sst and depth multiplying them\nsuitable_cells <- sst_rcl * bath_rcl\n\n# make 0's NA\nsuitable_cells[suitable_cells == 0] <- NA\n```\n:::\n\n\n### A.3: Area per EEZ\n\nNow that we know which areas off the West Coast of the USA are habitable for our species of interest, here oysters, based on SST and depth, we can calculate how much area is habitable in each exclusive economic zone (EEZ), to allow for comparison across zones.\n\nFirst, I will mask the habitable area in the west coast by cropping the eez data to the data, thus showing which area is habitable for oysters within each eez. I will also rasterize the eez data, and compute the area covered by each raster cell in km for downstream analysis.\n\nNext, I will calculate the total suitable area for each economic zone using the `zonal` function. I will end up with a dataframe with the suitable area per economic zone\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# crop suitable cells to eez\nsuitable_cropped <- crop(suitable_cells, eez)\n\n# rasterize eez\neez_rast <- rasterize(eez, suitable_cropped, field = \"area_km2\")\n\n# Compute the area covered by individual raster cells in km\nsuitable_cropped <- terra::cellSize(suitable_cropped, # Compute the area covered by individual raster cells\n                             mask=TRUE, # If TRUE, cells that are NA remain NA in the output\n                             lyrs=FALSE, # If TRUE and mask=TRUE, the output has the same number of layers as input\n                             unit=\"km\") # report the cell area in km\n\n# use zonal stats to get the sum of the area in each eez\nzones_suitarea <- terra::zonal(suitable_cropped, # x: SpatRaster\n                               eez_rast, # y: needs to be terra object\n                               fun = \"sum\", # sum up the area\n                               na.rm = TRUE) # remember to remove NA's!\n\n# update the column names from the initial dataframe of the eez\nzones_clean <- cbind(eez, zones_suitarea) %>%  \n  # clean dataframe for ease of use\n  dplyr::select(rgn, area_km2, area) %>% # select columns I care about\n  rename(\"suitable_area\" = \"area\") # rename to something prettier\n```\n:::\n\n\n### A.4: Build map\n\nI will now build a map of the amount of habitable area there is for this species (oysters) per exclusive economic zone.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap <- tm_shape(zones_clean) + # vector data, use tmshape. \n    tm_graticules() + # add graticules at this layer\n \n# next layer: fill by area of suitable habitat\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"suitable_area\", # column name with the values\n  # specify the color scale, using viridis because it is colorblind friendly\n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values =  viridis(2)), \n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Area of suitable habitat (km2)\", \n                                      position = tm_pos_out(\"right\"))) +\n  \n # next layer: show the outlines of the zones clearly\n  tm_borders(col = \"black\") + # borders of the counties\n\n# add map elements\n  tm_title(text = \"Suitable habitat for this species in each eez\") \n\nmap\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Part B: Generalizable workflow\n\nHere I build the function to encompass all that I've done so far, so I can input data for any species in this area and get a map output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuitable_habitat <- function(bath, # bathymetry raster\n                             eez, # eez spatial dataframe\n                             sst_c, # raster of sea surface temp; \n                             #with mean sst for the time period you want\n                             min_sst, # string with the minimum temp in C\n                             max_sst, # string with the max temp in C\n                             min_depth_m, # string with the minimum depth in m\n                             max_depth_m, # string with the maximum temp in m\n                             species_name) # string with species name\n  {\n#...............STEP 1: Bathymetry raster cleaning...............\n  # SAME CRS: project bath to sst_c\n       bath <- project(bath, sst_c) \n  # Now crop to same extent: crop bathymetry raster to extent of sst_c\n    bath_crop <- crop(bath, sst_c)\n  # now ensure in same resolution as sst by resampling, use nearest neighbor\n    bath_final <- resample(bath_crop, y = sst_c, \n                          method = \"near\") # for nearest neighbor\n\n#........STEP 2: build a suitable depth and temp raster.......\n    # build a matrix for reclassifying sst\n      sst_matrix <- matrix(c(-Inf, min_sst, 0, # from -inf temp to min temp, too cold, make a 0\n                        min_sst, max_sst, 1, # good zone!

This work also highlights the importance of making species-specific investigations into where to invest in marine aquaculture, as the oysters had more suitable area in South, but the South-most EEZ was the worst of the options for Red Urchin, which would have more area in the North. \n\nIt is important to note that this analysis does not take all important aspects of habitability for the species, or feasibility of using the area for aquaculture. This analysis and tool should be used as a first-step to determine where to look deeper into the feasibility of building marine aquaculture for a specific species. For example, an example of a future iteration of this tool would exclude areas with low phytoplanktonic food availability when considering bivalves (Gentry et al 2017), and exclude areas that are off-limits for aquaculture, like marine protected areas (MPAs), shipping lanes, and oil rigs, as done in Gentry et al 2017. This could be incorporated into this workflow by reading in maps of the MPAs, shipping areas, and areas owned by oil rigs, and subtracting them from the suitable areas.\n\n# Works Cited\n\n## Journal articles\n\nFroehlich, Halley E., Alexandra Smith, Rebecca R.
