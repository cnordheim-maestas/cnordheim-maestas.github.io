# Intro

One thing that I've learned quickly as a Teaching Assistant and research mentor in statistics and data visualization is that playing with color and customization is a great way to add personality and fun to coding! Without fail, the energy in the room always brightens when we introduce these concepts, but we often do not have time in class to go into depth on color palettes, color customization of different ggplot objects, and other fun ways to add some sparkle to your data visualization.

Note that these are just a few of my favorites, and there is a whole world of color palettes out there for so many interests! I hope this post gives enough background for you to explore and find your favorites too, and make your coding and graphing journey a bit more fun.

# Let's get coding!

Build base plots & load libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse) # data wrangling, and includes ggplot
library(paletteer) # package with a lot of color palettes
library(lterdatasampler) # data I will be using to show off the colors

# base plot
base_plot <- and_vertebrates %>%
  filter(species == "Coastal giant salamander") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sitecode, y = log(weight_g), fill = sitecode)) + # fill the boxes by the variable station
  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot
  labs(y = "Coastal giant salamander mass (log-g)", x= "Site Code") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) + # remove legend
  theme_minimal() 

base_plot_scatter <- and_vertebrates %>%
  filter(species == "Coastal giant salamander") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = length_1_mm, y = weight_g, color = sitecode)) + # color by the variable station
  geom_point() + # make a boxplot
  labs(x = "Coastal giant salamander length (mm)", y= "Coastal giant salamander mass (g)") +
  xlim(100,150) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) + # remove legend
  theme_minimal() 

# base plot
base_plot_twoboxes <- and_vertebrates %>%
  filter(species == "Coastal giant salamander" | species == "Cascade torrent salamander") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = log(weight_g), fill = species)) + # fill the boxes by the variable station
  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot
  labs(y = "Mass (log-g)", x= "Species") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) + # remove legend
  theme_minimal() 

```

## Taylor Swift Album Covers

First, let's use the direct color palette package, you can learn more at the package's github:
{{< fa brands github >}} [asteves tayloRswift github repository](https://github.com/asteves/tayloRswift)

Important note: there are 2 functions: one for **fill**: `scale_fill_taylor` and one for **color**: `scale_color_taylor`

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# install.packages(c("tayloRswift"))
library(tayloRswift) 

# Let's start with the album Lover
base_plot +
  scale_fill_taylor(palette = "lover", guide = "none") +
  ggtitle("Lover Color Palette from tayloRswift Package")
```

Now, we can try using the paleteer package to load in the palette (no need to install and load `library(tayloRswift)`)

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

base_plot_scatter +
  scale_color_manual(values = paletteer_d("tayloRswift::taylor1989")) +
  ggtitle("1989 Color Palette from tayloRswift Package")
```

But, what if I want to choose a couple specific colors from the HEX codes? I can use the `paleteer_d` function to see the HEX codes for each palette

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Let's check out Evermore
paletteer_d("tayloRswift::midnights")

# Let's say I only want the two of the colors, I can make a new object with the HEX codes output above

my_colors <- c("#B3A6A3FF", "#586891FF")

# Now I can specify these as the colors in my plot
base_plot_twoboxes +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  ggtitle("Selected colors from Midnights palette from tayloRswift Package")
```

## La Croix Colors

You can learn more at the package's github: {{< fa brands github >}} [johannesbjork LaCroixColoR github repository](https://github.com/johannesbjork/LaCroixColoR)

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Let's start with Pamplemousse

# see the hex codes
paletteer::paletteer_d("LaCroixColoR::Pamplemousse")

base_plot +
  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d("LaCroixColoR::Pamplemousse") + # NOTE: fill for the boxplot
  ggtitle("La Criox Pamplemousse Palette from LaCroixColoR Package") +
  
  # for fun, let's make the axes text the colors too
  theme(axis.title = element_text(color = "#172869FF"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "#EA7580FF"))

# Now let's do Lemon with a scatterplot

# see the hex codes
paletteer::paletteer_d("LaCroixColoR::Lemon") 

base_plot_scatter +
  paletteer::scale_color_paletteer_d("LaCroixColoR::Lemon") + # NOTE: color for the points
  ggtitle("La Criox Lemon Palette from LaCroixColoR Package")

```
