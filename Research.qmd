I am interested in the roles of reservoir hosts in wildlife disease transmission and persistence and how environmental stressors may impact these roles. My current doctoral work in the [Briggs Lab](https://briggslab.eemb.ucsb.edu/) includes studying the environmental persistence and potential reservoir hosts of Bd *(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)*, a fungus responsible for a catastrophic amphibian disease, in California. Please see the [Mentorship tab](https://cnordheim-maestas.github.io/Mentoring.html) for undergraduate mentee-led related research projects.

I worked as a lab manager and technician in the [Richards-Zawacki](https://www.rzlab.pitt.edu/) lab at the University of Pittsburgh between 2019-2021. Here, I participated in collaborative research on temperature and climate impact the ecology and evolution of Bd-Host interactions across the U.S., and various research on the coloration of Panamanian Strawberry Poison Dart Frogs. Please see the [Mentorship tab](https://cnordheim-maestas.github.io/Mentoring.html) for undergraduate mentee-led related research projects. â€‹

I conducted research on a wide variety of projects relating to Bd (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) over my four years as an undergraduate researcher in the [McMahon conservation disease ecology lab](https://www.instagram.com/mcmahon_lab/?hl=en) at the University of Tampa. This work encompassed examining the impacts of Bd on crayfish respiration, whether snails and algae are viable hosts of Bd, developing and testing Bd-vaccines on frogs, and more!

### Undergraduate Research - Arizona State University & UTampa

I studied how urbanization impacted amphibian and reptile communities during my summer research experience for undergraduates in the [Bateman Lab](https://hbateman.faculty.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University in collaboration with the NSF Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research Center and the [Froeschke Spatial Ecology Lab](https://www.ut.edu/directory/froeschke-bridgette) at the University of Tampa.
