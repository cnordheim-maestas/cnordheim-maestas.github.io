I am interested in the roles of reservoir hosts in wildlife disease transmission and persistence and how environmental stressors may impact these roles. My current doctoral work in the [Briggs Lab](https://briggslab.eemb.ucsb.edu/) includes studying the environmental persistence and potential reservoir hosts of Bd *(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)*, a fungus responsible for a catastrophic amphibian disease, in California. Please see the [Mentorship tab](https://cnordheim-maestas.github.io/Mentoring.html) for undergraduate mentee-led related research projects.

I worked as a lab manager and technician in the [Richards-Zawacki](https://www.rzlab.pitt.edu/) lab at the University of Pittsburgh between 2019-2021. Here, I participated in collaborative research on temperature and climate impact the ecology and evolution of Bd-Host interactions across the U.S., and various research on the coloration of Panamanian Strawberry Poison Dart Frogs.

I conducted research on a wide variety of projects relating to Bd (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*) over my four years as an undergraduate researcher in the [McMahon conservation disease ecology lab](https://www.instagram.com/mcmahon_lab/?hl=en) at the University of Tampa (now at Connecticut College). This work encompassed examining the impacts of Bd on crayfish respiration, whether snails and algae are viable hosts of Bd, developing and testing Bd-vaccines on frogs, and more!

### Undergraduate Research - Arizona State University & UTampa

I studied how urbanization impacted amphibian and reptile communities during my summer research experience for undergraduates in the [Bateman Lab](https://hbateman.faculty.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University in collaboration with the NSF Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research Center and the [Froeschke Spatial Ecology Lab](https://www.ut.edu/directory/froeschke-bridgette) at the University of Tampa.
