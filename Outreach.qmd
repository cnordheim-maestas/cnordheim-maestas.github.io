I am so proud to be one of the founding members of the [UC Santa
Barbara's Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology's Annual Undergraduate
Research Symposium](https://undergrad-symposium.eemb.ucsb.edu/)
(EEMB-URS, pronounced "embers").

Since it's start in 2021, this symposium has grown and developed so
much, and I love seeing the undergraduate research community come
together to celebrate their work, build connections, and develop
critical skills in science communication.

#### Publication

In 2023, we published a roadmap to creating undergraduate research
symposia, and conducted a study on how our symposium may increase the
retention of students of Excluded Identities in STEM, in the journal
*Oceanography* [@universityofcaliforniasantabarbara2023]. Our resources
for building an undergraduate research symposium can be found on this
github link: <https://github.com/madisonheard1/EEMBURS>. Here, you can
find our comprehensive handbook on how to build a symposium, survey
questions (developed with the UCSB IRB), presentation judging rubrics,
resources for students on abstract writing, and more!

#### Invited talks

I am excited to share our resources, findings, and journey with others
who are interested in creating similar symposia, and was honored to give
invited talks at the UCSB Inclusive Teaching Symposium and UC Berkeley's
Plant and Microbial Biology Department's Seminar. Please do not hesitate
to reach out if you are interested in learning more about our symposium
and resources!
