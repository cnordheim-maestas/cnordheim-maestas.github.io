## Hello! 

I'm Caitlin Nordheim-Maestas! I'm a third-year Ph.D. student who is especially passionate about wildlife conservation, disease ecology, and undergraduate research mentorship. 

I am in the [Briggs Lab](https://briggslab.eemb.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara studying amphibian disease ecology, specifically, the "chytrid fungus" *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*, in California.
