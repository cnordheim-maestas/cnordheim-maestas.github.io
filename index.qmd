## Hello! 

Hi, I'm Caitlin Nordheim-Maestas! I'm a third-year Ph.D. student who is especially passionate about wildlife conservation, disease ecology, and undergraduate research mentorship. 

I am in the Briggs Lab at UC Santa Barbara studying amphibian disease ecology, specifically, the "chytrid fungus" Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, in California.
